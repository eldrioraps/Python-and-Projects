Assignment: Design an Employee Payroll Module (OOP Based)
Scenario

1)You are working in the Payroll Automation Team of a company.
2)The API Team is developing REST endpoints to store and fetch employee payroll data.
3)Before they can do that, they need you to design a Python OOP module that manages:

Employee personal and job details:

Payroll calculations (basic salary, allowances, deductions, tax)
Utility validations (age, employee ID format, etc.)
Your design will be imported and reused by the API team.

Part 1 — Instructions:
You need to create three classes:

Class: Employee
Purpose: Represent a single employee’s identity and job details.

Attributes:

emp_id
name
age
department
base_salary

Methods:

__init__() → initialize employee details
show_details() → print employee info in readable format


Class: Payroll (inherits from Employee)

Purpose: Handle payroll calculations.

Attributes (in addition to inherited ones):

hra (House Rent Allowance)
bonus
tax
Methods:

calculate_gross_salary() → base_salary + hra + bonus
calculate_net_salary() → gross - tax
show_payslip() → nicely formatted salary breakdown


Class: PayrollUtility

Purpose: Common helper logic (static methods).

Methods (all static):

validate_age(age) → must be between 18 and 60
validate_emp_id(emp_id) → must be exactly 6 digits
calculate_tax(salary) →

<= 250000 → 0%
<= 500000 → 5%
<= 1000000 → 20%
> 1000000 → 30%


Part 2 — How the API Team Will Use It

The API team won’t handle any logic; they will just call your classes.

Here’s how they will integrate it 

from payroll_module import Employee, Payroll, PayrollUtility

# Step 1: Validate employee data
if PayrollUtility.validate_age(25) and PayrollUtility.validate_emp_id("123456"):
    
    # Step 2: Create employee record
    emp = Payroll("123456", "Ravi", 25, "IT", 500000, hra=20000, bonus=10000)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate tax and net salary
    tax = PayrollUtility.calculate_tax(emp.base_salary)
    emp.tax = tax
    
    # Step 4: Show payroll summary
    emp.show_payslip()
else:
    print("Invalid employee details!")


Part 3 — Expected Output (Example)
Employee Created Successfully
Employee ID: 123456
Name: Priya
Department: IT

Gross Salary: ₹530000
Tax: ₹100000
Net Salary: ₹430000
