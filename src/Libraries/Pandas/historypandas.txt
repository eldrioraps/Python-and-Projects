pandas it is an open source library that is used across ML projects or data analytics project 
for data maipulation wrangling transformations and analysis.

suppose we have to prepare a ml model to predict the outcomes based 
on input features required for an enterprise dataset.
medical invoices:
customer
quantity
price
medicene type
disease
date 
address
total invoice amount


now you have to prepare a ml model which helps the pharmacy to maintain the inventory.
you will take the input fetaures as an categories that will predict the inventory output

How to get teh proper data and how to do the tweaks.
invoices an as image on the sharepoint 
now what you can extract teh data and make the csv out of it, once you get teh csv now we can manipulate the data like important fields
removing of nulls, redundant data removal and categorisation of fieldsn 
as reuired.

so do all this we need some softyware trhat is python for now.
so pandas here allow us to semalessly integrate the architect and automate the process.

so we will make a end to end solution for this proicess an dpandas basically will allowus to prepare the 
required datasetv for the ML and all the tweaks that need to be done will bedoine in pandas.


2) log processing: getting teh log files on email and then integrate that 
with python and storte the processed data into sql table an dthen make bi report on it.
